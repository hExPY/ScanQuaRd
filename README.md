# ScanQuaRd

## Idea

I want to build an opensource web-app to create and manage QR codes. These QR codes can be protected from the management to make sure the data is secure. The use-case is e.g. you're traveling and somehow your luggage is lost, you can unprotect it to make it visible to the scanning person.

## Starter

This project is heavily under construction and is based on https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-full-stack-webapp-starter-kit
